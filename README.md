# ecigSpTranscriptome
Spatial transcriptome of e-cig induced transcriptional changes.

This repository contains scripts and data to reproduce the analysis and figures used in the paper.

Various types of data such as spatial transcriptome (stRNA-seq), single nucles snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq.
Analysis of each data types are saved in separate folders.

There are 5 main folders that constitute different data analysis

## Data Analysis Overview
This repository contains different data analysis folders.

## **stRNAseq** 
This folder contains the scripts to reproduce spatial transcriptomics data.
### Steps:
1. Preprocess the data
2. Run velocity analysis
3. Visualize results

## **stRNAseq_StereoSeq**

## **snRNAseq**

## **rnaVelocity**

## **enrichmentHuman**
### Steps:
1. Download human PsyhcENCODE data
2. Preprocess the data and get rat orthologous data
3. Run vanalysis
4. Visualize results
