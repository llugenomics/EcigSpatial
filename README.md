# ecigSpTranscriptome
Spatial transcriptome of e-cig induced transcriptional changes.

This repository contains scripts and data to reproduce the analysis and figures used in the paper.

Various types of data such as spatial transcriptome (stRNA-seq), single nucles snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq.
Analysis of each data types are saved in separate folders.

There are 5 main folders that constitute different data analysis

## Data Analysis Overview
This repository contains different data analysis folders.

## **stRNAseq** 
### This folder contains the scripts to reproduce spatial transcriptomics data.

## **stRNAseq_StereoSeq**

## **snRNAseq**

## **rnaVelocity**

## **enrichmentHuman**

There is README file inside each folder that helps to run the data analysis step by step.
